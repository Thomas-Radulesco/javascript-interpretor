## Simple command interpretor in JavaScript

This is a fork from a plain JavaScript exercise I had to do during my web developer course at O'Clock's. <br>
The exercise was used to make sure students were willing and capable of fulfilling the React specialization. <br>
I had much fun doing it, so I added some features (comment skipping and sounds) and [deployed it to surge.sh](http://interpretor.surge.sh "Interpretor on surge.sh").

### Instructions

You can simply clone it and open `index.html` in your browser.<br>
